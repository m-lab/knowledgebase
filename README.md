# M-Lab Knowledge Base

This repository houses the source for the https://kb.measurementlab.net website. We use this website to share information about datasets, software and tools that help M-Lab community members get the most out of experimental data, tools and the global infrastructure we manage.


## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Adding content

**To add an article**, create a `.md` file in `src/content/articles/`:

```markdown
---
title: My Article
description: What this article covers.
tags: [getting-started]
difficulty: beginner
---

Your content here.
```

That's it — the article appears on the home page automatically.

**To add a tag**, edit `src/data/tags.ts` and add an entry to the `TAGS` array. A tag page is generated automatically.

**To customize branding**, edit `src/config.ts` — change the site title, tagline, colors, and navigation.

## Tracking open items (TODO / FIXME)

Articles can carry inline work-in-progress markers as HTML comments — invisible on the published site, but tracked in source:

```html
<!-- TODO: Add worked example of computing per-connection jitter. -->
<!-- FIXME: Verify these column paths against the current schema. -->
```

Use `TODO` for missing content or follow-ups, and `FIXME` for things believed wrong or unverified in the text as published.

List every open item across all articles with:

```bash
npm run todo
```

This prints each marker grouped by severity (FIXME first) and file, with line numbers, and exits cleanly when none remain. Run it before releases or when picking up editorial work to see what's outstanding. Markers are only detected in `src/content/articles/*.md(x)`, one per line.

## Front matter

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | **Required.** Article title |
| `description` | string | Short summary shown on cards |
| `tags` | string[] | Tag names from `src/data/tags.ts` |
| `difficulty` | string | `beginner` \| `intermediate` \| `advanced` |
| `standalone` | boolean | `true` hides the article from index/tags/search |

## Callout boxes

Use callout boxes to highlight tips, important notes, warnings, or caveats. Write them as raw HTML in your markdown file — Astro's markdown renderer doesn't process markdown syntax inside HTML blocks, so write links and emphasis as HTML:

```html
<div class="callout callout--tip">
<span class="callout-icon">💡</span>
<div class="callout-body"><p>Content here. Use <strong>bold</strong> and <a href="...">links</a> as HTML.</p></div>
</div>
```

Four variants:

| Class | Color | Icon | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `callout--note` | Blue | ℹ️ | Definitions, context, cross-references |
| `callout--tip` | Green | 💡 | "Try it yourself", helpful shortcuts, Binder links |
| `callout--warn` | Yellow | ⚠️ | Caveats, gotchas, things that may surprise |
| `callout--danger` | Red | ❗ | Data quality issues, breaking changes, errors |

**Do not use markdown `>` blockquotes for callouts.** Reserve `>` for actual quoted text (citations, attribution).

## Inline code

Wrap terms, column names, file paths, and short code snippets in backticks: `` `download_p50` ``, `` `country_code` ``. The site renders them as gray rounded pills — no extra decoration needed.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**
3. The included workflow builds and deploys on every push to `main`
